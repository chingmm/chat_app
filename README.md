# General Info
A chat app that utilizes websockets in order to send and receive messages without having to refresh the page. Authentication is built in so that users only see messages related to who they interact with.

Apollo Server is the framework used for the server side, and Apollo client is what is being used to consume the Graphql API on the React frontend. Graphql is what is being used to incorporate the web sockets connection in order to have a listener for real-time changes such as a new user created, or messages being received/sent.

The playground space generated by Apollo Server was used to test creating with mutations users/messages and listing out created users/messages with queries. Apollo Server is being used versus Postman since Postman's functionality with Graphql still seems limited.

Sequelize is the ORM being used to interact with Nodejs in order to connect to the postgres database.
